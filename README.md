# Pathfinding Visualization

## Description

This is a visualization of the A*, BFS, Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm. The user can draw walls and move the start and end nodes. The
algorithm will then find the shortest path between the start and end nodes. The user can also change the speed of the
algorithm and clear the board.
